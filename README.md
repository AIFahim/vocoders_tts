# vocoders_tts
For vocoder training [coqui tts](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS) repo used. 
And the training scripts of the vocoders can be found in: [`training_scripts`](https://github.com/AIFahim/vocoders_tts/tree/master/training_scripts) folder. 

Sometimes vocoder models are GAN based so to remove the discriminator part from the weight some helper functions are written. Can be found in [`renaming_weights_helper_functions`](https://github.com/AIFahim/vocoders_tts/tree/master/renaming_weights_helper_functions)
